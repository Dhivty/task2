# To-Do List Web Application

This is a basic To-Do List web application that allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, or delete them. The tasks are saved to the browser's localStorage so that they persist even after refreshing the page.

## Project Structure

### Files

- *index.html*: Contains the HTML structure for the To-Do List interface.
- *styles.css*: The CSS file that styles the To-Do List app.
- *script1.js*: The JavaScript file that provides the functionality for adding, deleting, marking tasks as complete, and storing tasks in localStorage.
- *list.png*: The favicon for the webpage.
- *unchecked.png*: The image used for unchecked tasks.
- *checked.png*: The image used for checked tasks.

### Features

- *Add Task*: Users can input text into the input field and click "Add" to create a new task in the list.
- *Mark Task as Complete*: Clicking on a task will toggle its completion status, with a strikethrough indicating completion.
- *Delete Task*: Clicking the 'Ã—' symbol next to a task will remove it from the list.
- *Persistent Data*: The tasks are saved in the browser's localStorage, ensuring they are retained even if the page is reloaded or closed and reopened.
